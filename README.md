Smart bookshelf

I. Introduction
----

This team has been created for a joint project between the Software Engineering (SE) and the Artificial Intelligence and Application (AI) courses in Hanyang University.

**Motivation**

The **Smart Bookshelf** project comes from the observation that many people today don't have the time or the motivation to read new books as they navigate their fast paced and overstimulated everyday life. Our goal is to provide with this smart bookshelf and application a simpler way to manage the books people are reading, whether it's by swapping from the physical book to the audiobook, by reminding them to read at certain times or by recommending them new books based on their current preferences.

In the AI part, we will mainly focus on the book management and suggestion. This includes some image recognition libraries to scan the barcode or the ISBN number and recover the book data from that information, or to scan the book cover and search for the book from those informations. Then we will be building some prediction algorithms, based on graphs, schemes and statistics from existing libraries and APIs, to determine the closest books to be recommended to a specific user.

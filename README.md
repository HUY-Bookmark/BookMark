I. Introduction
----

This team has been created for a joint project between the Software Engineering (SE) and the Artificial Intelligence and Application (AI) courses in Hanyang University.

**Abstract**

Nowadays, modern people (workers, students, etc.) lack time for reading books. Although they have motivation to read, the time for reading has low priority amongst the 24 hours of the day when people are investing time in various activities such as studying, working, or exercising. For example, even if you want to read a book, the hardships of choosing and purchasing a book yourself are an obstacle to reading.

Therefore, we created the application BookMark to overcome these difficulties. BookMark is meant to help the customers manage their bookshelf, either physical or digital, and arrange more time in their daily life to read. It provides a system of notifications and reminders to keep track of the books the user is currently reading. It makes the bookshelf management easier by using simple image recognition to search for a book by its cover or barcode or ISBN number, automatically sorting the content and providing different pairing options between physical copies, ebooks or audiobooks. By automatizing the usually difficult part of book management, BookMark wishes to let the reader make more space in his or her day to actually read.

**AI Motivation**

The **BookMark** project comes from the observation that many people today don't have the time or the motivation to read new books as they navigate their fast paced and overstimulated everyday life. Our goal is to provide with this smart bookshelf and application a simpler way to manage the books people are reading, whether it's by swapping from the physical book to the audiobook, by reminding them to read at certain times or by recommending them new books based on their current preferences, or by recommending new books to the users.

In the AI part, we will mainly focus on the book management and suggestion. This includes some image recognition libraries to scan the barcode or the ISBN number and recover the book data from that information, or to scan the book cover and search for the book from those informations. Then we will be building some prediction algorithms, based on graphs, schemes and statistics from existing libraries and APIs, to determine the closest books to be recommended to a specific user.
